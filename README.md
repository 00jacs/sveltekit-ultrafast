# sveltekit-ultrafast ‚ö°Ô∏è

The `sveltekit-ultrafast` is a boilerplate for rapid prototyping of web applications which is easily deployable to Vercel or other effortless platforms.

## Why sveltekit-ultrafast?

‚ö°Ô∏è super fast application development

üí∏ effortless, cheap (or even free) deployment & maintenance

üß™ quick prototype = fast reitaration = quick idea validation

üí® highly performant app (Svelte drastically faster than React)

‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• developer-friendly, pleasant stack

With this boilerplate you can create (and effortlessly deploy) a fully-functioning MVP for which you can charge $ within days or even hours (depends on the idea).

Why waste more time on creating something no one will use and purchase?

## Contribution guide

In case you have any suggestions, feel free to create an issue on this repository or create a pull request for the changes that you'd like to see.

## IN-PROGRESS

The repository is still in progress. These are the things that will have to be completed:

- payments (Stripe)
- mailing service (Mailgun/Mailchimp)
- UI block samples for: pricing, contacts, landing page
- beautiful UI kit with more elements (DaisyUI-based)

## On the way

In the upcoming future, I will be creating a landing page with full documentation and tips for this boilerplate. Also, I will be adding more blocks/templates to make it even faster to create web apps.

## Technologies

### Main

- **TypeScript** (optional) - you can use TypeScript (recommended for type safety), but you don't have to; no errors will be thrown if you use both JavaScript and TypeScript in this app
- **SvelteKit** - fastest, easiest, cleanest front-end framework with SSR

### Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** - definitely fastest for rapid prototyping
- **DaisyUI** - most popular UI kit for Tailwind CSS, great components and nice UI
- **Custom UI component** - I've included `/lib/components/common` directory with "component wrappers" for DaisyUI which makes it really easy to modify the components globally; also, their design and functionality is being improved

### Database

For database, we use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/database) which provides hussle-free ways of utilizing PostgreSQL databases into web apps.

### Payments

Using Stripe for handling payments - most effortless to set up, it literally takes 5 minutes.

## 1. Adjust prettier/eslint settings (optional)

If the prefer a different prettier/eslint configuration, feel free to adjust it:

- `.eslintrc.cjs` to update all the eslint rules
- `.prettierrc` for all the prettier code formatting rules

## 2. Update VSCode settings for optimal development experience (recommended)

Paste this in your `settings.json` in VSCode:

```JSON
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.documentSelectors": ["**/*.svelte"],
  "[svelte]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "svelte.svelte-vscode",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },
```

This will automatically take care of the Prettier formatting based on the specified `.prettierrc` configuration.
This will make sure that all the code throughout your application is properly formatted so that you don't have to worry about that and make the entire development process much faster.

## 3. Install all the dependencies

Run `npm i` when in the `sveltekit-asap-boilerplate` directory.

## 4. Create a supabase project

Register your project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) if you plan to have authentication & database-related features.

Create an `.env` file and fill this with: `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL, SUPABASE_PROJECT_API_KEY` which you can easily get after you create a free project on Supabase.

## 5. Next steps

This is not yet fully ready, but you can follow the `docs.md` files in each of the `/routes` directory to get started with this boilerplate.
