# Google Analytics ðŸ“ˆ

Without analytics, you know nothing about the traffic on your website.

_What you don't track, you can' improve._

## How to set up?

Setting it up is super easy:

1. Create a Google Analytics project.
2. Add your `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_ID` as `.env`.

And you should be good to go! ðŸŽ‰

## Custom analytics events

The `/analytics` route shows how you can track custom events with `gtag` and Google Analytics.

But the super basic setup will still allow you to track page views on each of your pages which is also going to be super useful.
